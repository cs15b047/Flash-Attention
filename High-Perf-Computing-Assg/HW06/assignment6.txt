Q1.
a) Level 1: scalar-vector and vector-vector operations
Level 2: matrix-vector operations
Level 3: Matrix - matrix operations

b) banded matrix vector multiply: Non-zero elements are present only in bands around the diagonal. Data to be read/computed upon is reduced depending on the band length
symmetric matrix vector multiply: (Almost) Half of the elements are redundant, so need not be read/computed on.

f) cuBLAS is approximately 7-8 times faster than the HW05 implementation
