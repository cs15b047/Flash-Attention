Q3 b) 
Bandwidth approxmns:

Bandwidth = Data size / Time for transfer

For highest data size: 2^25 floats --> 4 byte per float --> 128MB data for 1 transfer
Total Data = 2 transfers --> 256MB = 0.25GB

Time for transfer --> half of time measured (t0 + t1) since it is measured on 2 different machines [264.713 millisec = 0.264 sec]
Time for transfer = 0.264/2 sec = 0.132 sec

Approx bandwidth = 0.25GB/0.132sec ~ 1.88 GB/s = 15.1 Gbps


Latency approxmns:

Time for smallest data packet (8 bytes), although this includes MPI overhead also.

Time for 2 transfers for both machines added = 5.678 millisec
Time for 1 transfer = 5.678/4 = 1.4 millisec (around ~1-1.5 millisec)

Latency ~ 1.5 ms
